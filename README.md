# React Hooks

Three projects to use React Hooks in different ways. Based on the Udemy's course "React Hooks" by Reed Barger.

In order to run the `hook-todos` React app, you need first to deploy the `hooks-api` using [Now](https://zeit.co/home) by installing the `Now CLI`. Put the host URL of the deployed service in the `config.js`.

### Run the Todos app

```sh
cd hooks-todos
yarn start
```
